### Right now It's just a home-made user interface

The idea which brough me to start this project was building a program which analase a .dat file which is the log of the played games of MTGO (magic the gathering online). So far I only built the UI. I miss any log file, so I'm not able to keep working on this. 

I would like to copy the .dat file in a folder and then use it to generate an exel file (.xml / .xlsx / .xltm), which is going to be the start point of the whole analysis. I wanna use an excell file to make it easly readable, moreover anybody may use those data to make their own analysis. 

In the end, from the excell file I would like to build another excell file which show the analysis. That is for the same reason explained above.
